## 📄 This project in short

This project, led by Julien GENESTE, was created in response to the many fires in Gironde and more generally in France. It follows on from the [POCDroneReforestation](https://github.com/Kariboo-Corp/POCDroneReforestation) project, in which an **Unmanned Aerial Vehicle** (UAV) equiped with a **seed cannon** was developped. At that point, the drone could only be teleoperated. The [first video](https://youtu.be/yf7zY1jwji8) shows the results of that project, i.e. our starting point.

The idea of this project is to make the drone autonomous using the middleware [ROS 2 (Humble)](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html). The objectives are as follows:
- Find a way to **precisely locate** the drone at all times during the planting process
- Make the drone **aware of its environment** using the proper sensors. (Is the terrain suitable for planting? Are there obstacles?)
- **Generate a trajectory** to accomplish the mission, ensuring it is as **efficient** as possible.

To summarize, we use **RTK** to locate the drone, a **3D camera** to detect obstacles beneath the drone and we define a **Back and Forth Path (BFP)** to cover the area. The [second video](https://youtu.be/EM3NkIjqCws) presents an example of a trajectory generated by our algorithms.
