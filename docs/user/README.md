This section describes the process to follow in order to obtain a result such as the one presented in [the video above](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuNU0X7J_0g). 

⚠️ **Note :** Be aware that we are working with **global GPS coordinates**, which means that if you ask the drone to plant trees in Australia from France, it will probably do it. By default, in the simulation, the drone takes off in Zurich Switzerland, Irchel Park. It might be advised to do the tests in that area, or to change the take-off location accordingly.
