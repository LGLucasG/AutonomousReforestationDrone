# 📈 Project Report

As a reminder, the objectives of this project were as follows:
- Find a way to **precisely locate** the drone at all times during the planting process
- Make the drone **aware of its environment** using the proper sensors. (Is the terrain suitable for planting? Are there obstacles?)
- **Generate a trajectory** to accomplish the mission, ensuring it is as **efficient** as possible.

This report discusses the status of each objective and what could be done next.
